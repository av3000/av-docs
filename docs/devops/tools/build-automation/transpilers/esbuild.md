# esbuild

esbuild is an extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier written in Go. Created by Evan Wallace (co-founder of Figma), it reimagines build tooling with a focus on performance, offering speeds often 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based alternatives.

According to esbuild official documentation here are its major features:

- Extreme speed without needing a cache
- JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, and JSX built-in
- A straightforward API for CLI, JS, and Go
- Bundles ESM and CommonJS modules
- Bundles CSS including CSS modules
- Tree shaking, minification, and source maps
- Local server, watch mode, and plugins

## Core Functionality

esbuild's approach includes:

- Parsing, bundling, and minifying JavaScript/TypeScript in a single pass
- Handling ES modules and CommonJS modules
- Processing JSX/TSX syntax
- Supporting CSS imports and basic CSS processing
- Providing built-in functionality without plugins for common needs
- Generating highly optimized output code

## Key Features

- **Extraordinary Speed**: 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based alternatives
- **Self-Contained Binary**: No dependencies required to run
- **JS/TS/JSX Support**: Built-in transpilation for modern JavaScript syntax
- **Bundling Capabilities**: Resolves and bundles module dependencies
- **Minification**: Fast and effective JavaScript and CSS minification
- **Tree Shaking**: Eliminates unused code through static analysis
- **Source Maps**: Generates source maps for debugging
- **API Options**: Offers CLI, JS API, and Go API interfaces

## What Makes esbuild Different?

esbuild's key differentiators:

1. **Performance-First Design**: Built from the ground up in Go for speed, not as an incremental improvement on existing tools.

2. **Unified Processing**: Handles parsing, transformation, and generation in a single pass, unlike the multi-step pipelines of other tools.

3. **Multi-threading by Default**: Parallel processing is built into its core design, not added as an optimization.

4. **Minimalist Philosophy**: Focuses on doing common tasks extremely well rather than supporting every possible use case through plugins.

5. **Low-level Implementation**: Direct implementation of all functionality rather than depending on other packages or tools.

6. **Development Experience Focus**: Prioritizes fast feedback loops during development over ultimate optimization flexibility.

## Example Usage

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Simple bundling
esbuild app.js --bundle --outfile=out.js

# With minification and source maps
esbuild app.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=out.js

# TypeScript and JSX
esbuild app.tsx --bundle --format=esm --outfile=out.js

# Watch mode
esbuild app.js --bundle --watch --outfile=out.js
```

### JavaScript API

```javascript
// Basic bundling
const { build } = require("esbuild");

build({
  entryPoints: ["app.js"],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: "out.js",
}).catch(() => process.exit(1));

// More advanced configuration
build({
  entryPoints: ["app.tsx"],
  bundle: true,
  minify: true,
  sourcemap: true,
  target: ["chrome58", "firefox57", "safari11", "edge16"],
  outfile: "out.js",
  loader: { ".png": "dataurl", ".svg": "text" },
  define: { "process.env.NODE_ENV": '"production"' },
}).catch(() => process.exit(1));
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Separate Type Checking from Transpilation

```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking separately
tsc --noEmit

# Use esbuild for transpilation only
esbuild src/**/*.ts --outdir=dist
```

### 2. Use the Right Target for Browser Compatibility

```javascript
build({
  // Specific browser versions
  target: ["es2020", "chrome80", "firefox72", "safari13", "edge18"],

  // Or use browserslist
  target: ["esnext"], // For modern browsers
});
```

### 3. Optimize for Development vs. Production

```javascript
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

build({
  entryPoints: ["src/app.js"],
  bundle: true,
  minify: isProduction,
  sourcemap: !isProduction,
  target: isProduction ? ["es2018"] : ["esnext"],
  watch: !isProduction,
  outfile: "dist/app.js",
});
```

### 4. Use External Files for Large Packages

```javascript
build({
  entryPoints: ["src/app.js"],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: "dist/app.js",
  external: ["react", "react-dom", "lodash"],
});
```

### 5. Leverage Metafile for Bundle Analysis

```javascript
const result = await build({
  entryPoints: ["src/app.js"],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: "dist/app.js",
  metafile: true,
});

// Output bundle analysis
console.log(await analyzeMetafile(result.metafile));
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Incremental Builds with Context

```javascript
const { context } = require("esbuild");

async function build() {
  // Create a context
  const ctx = await context({
    entryPoints: ["src/app.js"],
    bundle: true,
    outfile: "dist/app.js",
  });

  // First build
  await ctx.rebuild();

  // Watch for changes
  await ctx.watch();

  // Clean up when done
  // ctx.dispose();
}

build();
```

### Worker Threads for Node.js Applications

```javascript
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");

// Offload esbuild to a worker thread
function runEsbuild() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker("./esbuild-worker.js");
    worker.on("message", resolve);
    worker.on("error", reject);
  });
}
```

### Optimize Bundling with Code Splitting

```javascript
build({
  entryPoints: ["src/app.js", "src/admin.js"],
  bundle: true,
  outdir: "dist",
  format: "esm",
  splitting: true, // Enable code splitting (only works with ESM)
  chunkNames: "chunks/[name]-[hash]",
});
```

## Current Status (2025)

esbuild has firmly established itself as the performance standard in the JavaScript build tool ecosystem. Its influence extends beyond direct usage, as many tools now benchmark their performance against esbuild and incorporate similar design principles.

Key trends include:

1. **Hybrid Usage**: Often used for development builds, with more feature-rich tools for production
2. **Embedded Integration**: Integrated into higher-level tools like Vite, Astro, and others
3. **TypeScript Ecosystem**: Widely adopted for TS transpilation when type checking is separate
4. **Plugin Growth**: Expanded plugin ecosystem for specialized needs
5. **Enterprise Adoption**: Increasingly used in large organizations to reduce build times

While esbuild excels at speed and simplicity, the ecosystem has evolved toward pragmatic approaches where esbuild handles performance-critical paths while other tools provide additional functionality where needed. This complementary approach allows teams to leverage esbuild's speed while maintaining access to the rich ecosystem of traditional JavaScript tooling.
