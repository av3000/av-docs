# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 4 pillars of object-oriented programming

1. Encapsulation: This is the concept of bundling data fields and methods or functions that operate on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to the data and only allows access through well-defined methods, ensuring data security and integrity.

2. Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It simplifies the interaction with objects by focusing on what an object does, rather than how it does it, typically through abstract classes or interfaces.

3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new child class to inherit properties and behaviors of fields and methods from an existing parent class. This helps in code reusability and establishing a hierarchy between related classes.

4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects or methods to take many forms. It enables a single method or class to behave differently based on the context. This is achieved through method overloading i.e. compile-time polymorphism and method overriding i.e. runtime polymorphism.
