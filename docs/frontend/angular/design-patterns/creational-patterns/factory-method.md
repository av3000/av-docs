# Factory Method Pattern

[https://dev.to/coly010/the-factory-pattern-design-patterns-meet-the-frontend-1p2l](https://dev.to/coly010/the-factory-pattern-design-patterns-meet-the-frontend-1p2l)

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that adds an abstraction layer over common base behaviour between multiple objects of a generic type.
The client code, the code that will use this layer, does not need to know the specifics of the implementation of the behaviour, as long as it exists.
