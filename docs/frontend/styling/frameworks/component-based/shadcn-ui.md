# shadcn/ui

shadcn/ui represents a modern approach to component libraries, offering a collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## What is shadcn/ui?

shadcn/ui is not a traditional component library. It's a collection of accessible, customizable, and open-source UI components that you copy and paste into your projects. Created by [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn), it combines the accessibility features of Radix UI with the styling flexibility of Tailwind CSS.

## Key Features

- **Copy and Paste**: Components are not installed as a dependency but copied directly into your project
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Uses Tailwind for all styling needs
- **Radix UI Foundation**: Built on top of Radix UI for accessibility and behavior
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed components
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt components to match your design system
- **CLI Tool**: Includes a CLI for adding components to your project
- **Framework Support**: Works with React, Next.js, and other React-based frameworks

## Why It Emerged

shadcn/ui emerged from the need for more flexible UI components that developers could fully own and customize. Traditional component libraries often have limitations:

1. **Dependency Overhead**: Updates can break your code
2. **Limited Customization**: Styling through props or complex theming systems
3. **Bundle Size**: Importing a library adds to your bundle size

shadcn/ui addressed these issues by promoting a "copy and paste" model where developers own the component code directly.

## Pros

- **No Dependencies**: Components live in your codebase, eliminating version conflicts
- **Full Ownership**: Complete control over the code with no black boxes
- **Progressive Updates**: Update components on your own schedule
- **Excellent Documentation**: Clear, concise documentation with live examples
- **Active Community**: Growing ecosystem with additional community components
- **Design Flexibility**: Easier to match your brand's design system
- **Scale-Friendly**: Only include components you actually use

## Cons

- **Manual Updates**: No automatic updates when bugs are fixed
- **Project Setup Required**: Needs Tailwind CSS and other dependencies configured
- **React-Only**: Not available for other frameworks like Vue or Svelte
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of both Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Maintenance Responsibility**: You must maintain the components yourself

## When to Use It

- When you want full control over your component code
- For projects with a strong focus on design customization
- When building design systems that need to evolve independently
- For long-term projects where dependency updates could be disruptive
- When working with React and Tailwind CSS already
- When accessibility is a priority

## When Not to Use It

- For quick prototypes where setup time is limited
- When team members are unfamiliar with Tailwind CSS
- When you need official support and guarantees
- If your project uses a different styling approach than Tailwind
- If you're not using React

## Problems It Solves

1. **Dependency Hell**: Eliminates dependency version conflicts
2. **Design System Flexibility**: Easier customization without fighting against pre-styled components
3. **Bundle Size Optimization**: Include only what you need
4. **Accessibility Without Effort**: Built on accessible primitives
5. **Dark Mode Support**: First-class support for light/dark theming
6. **Design Consistency**: Pre-built components that work together

## What It's Best For

shadcn/ui excels in projects where:

- Long-term maintenance is a concern
- Design customization is essential
- Developer experience is prioritized
- Accessibility is a requirement
- Projects already using Tailwind CSS and React

## Comparison with Other Libraries

| Library     | Component Ownership | Styling Approach | Framework Support  | Update Method   |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| shadcn/ui   | Full ownership      | Tailwind CSS     | React-only         | Manual updates  |
| Material UI | Dependency          | JSS/Emotion      | React-only         | Package updates |
| Chakra UI   | Dependency          | Styled System    | React-only         | Package updates |
| Bootstrap   | Dependency          | CSS classes      | Framework-agnostic | Package updates |
| Radix UI    | Dependency          | Unstyled         | React-only         | Package updates |

## Framework Compatibility

shadcn/ui is specifically designed for React-based applications. It is not framework-agnostic and works best with:

- React
- Next.js
- Remix
- Vite (React)
- Gatsby

## Getting Started

To use shadcn/ui in your project:

1. Set up a new project with React and Tailwind CSS
2. Add the required dependencies:
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Radix UI primitives
   - clsx/cva for class variance handling
3. Install the CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -D @shadcn/ui
   ```
4. Initialize the configuration:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui init
   ```
5. Add components as needed:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui add button
   ```

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dialog";

export function DialogDemo() {
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="outline">Open Dialog</Button>
      </DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent className="sm:max-w-[425px]">
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Edit profile</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>
            Make changes to your profile here.
          </DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        {/* Dialog content */}
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```
