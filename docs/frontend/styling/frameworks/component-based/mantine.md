# Mantine

Mantine is a comprehensive React components library with a focus on developer experience, accessibility, and customizable theming.

## What is Mantine?

Mantine is a fully-featured React components library that combines the flexibility of a modern styling system with the convenience of pre-built components. It provides more than 100 customizable components and hooks to build modern web applications.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Library**: 100+ components and hooks
- **First-class TypeScript Support**: Fully typed API
- **Theming System**: Easy customization with CSS variables
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in support for light/dark modes
- **Accessibility**: Most components follow WAI-ARIA standards
- **Server-side Rendering**: Works with Next.js, Remix, and other SSR frameworks
- **Framework Integration**: Native support for React Router, Next.js, Vite, and more
- **Unstyled Components**: Headless components available for full styling freedom
- **Hooks Library**: Extensive collection of React hooks for common UI patterns

## Why It Emerged

Mantine was created to provide a more flexible and developer-friendly alternative to existing React UI libraries. It emerged to address several pain points:

1. **Complex Theming**: Many libraries make customization difficult
2. **Poor Developer Experience**: Difficult APIs and confusing documentation
3. **Limited Component Set**: Insufficient component coverage for modern applications
4. **Accessibility Afterthoughts**: A11y not baked into the core design
5. **Bundle Size Concerns**: Oversized libraries impacting performance

## Pros

- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API design and excellent documentation
- **Customization**: Easy theming with CSS variables
- **Component Variety**: Wide range of components covering most UI needs
- **Native Dark Mode**: First-class support for color schemes
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and improvements
- **Strong TypeScript Support**: Well-typed for improved developer experience
- **Zero Dependencies**: No external dependencies for core components
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any React setup
- **Modular Import**: Import only what you need

## Cons

- **React-Only**: Not available for other frameworks like Vue or Svelte
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive API can take time to master
- **Bundle Size**: Can be large if many components are used
- **Styling Approach**: Uses CSS-in-JS which may not fit all workflows
- **Less Popular**: Smaller community compared to Material UI or Chakra UI
- **Design Opinion**: Has its own design language that may not match your brand

## When to Use It

- For React applications that need a complete UI component set
- When developer experience is a priority
- When building admin panels, dashboards, or internal tools
- For projects that need robust theming capabilities
- When dark mode is a requirement
- When you need strong TypeScript support
- For projects where accessibility is important

## When Not to Use It

- For non-React projects
- When you need a minimal bundle size
- If you prefer utility-first CSS (like Tailwind)
- When you need a specific design language implementation (like Material Design)
- If your team prefers CSS modules or other styling approaches
- For extremely simple projects where a full library is overkill

## Problems It Solves

1. **UI Development Speed**: Accelerates building complex interfaces
2. **Consistent Theming**: Provides a robust system for design tokens
3. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Simplifies light/dark theme switching
4. **Form Handling**: Offers form management with validation
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Implements ARIA standards by default
6. **Responsive Design**: Components are mobile-friendly out of the box
7. **Common UI Patterns**: Provides solutions for modals, popovers, notifications, etc.

## What It's Best For

Mantine excels in:

- Mid to large-scale React applications
- Admin dashboards and internal tools
- Applications requiring complex forms
- Projects with strong accessibility requirements
- Teams looking for a balanced approach between customization and pre-built components
- Applications needing a comprehensive theming system

## Comparison with Other Libraries

| Library     | Styling Approach          | Component Count | Theming        | Framework Support   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Mantine     | CSS-in-JS / CSS Variables | 100+            | Robust         | React-only          |
| Material UI | CSS-in-JS (Emotion)       | 100+            | Theme Provider | React-only          |
| Chakra UI   | Styled System             | 70+             | Theme Provider | React-only          |
| Ant Design  | Less/CSS                  | 60+             | Theme Config   | React, Angular, Vue |
| shadcn/ui   | Tailwind CSS              | 40+             | Tailwind       | React-only          |

## Framework Compatibility

Mantine is specifically designed for React-based applications. It works well with:

- Create React App
- Next.js
- Vite
- Remix
- Gatsby

While it's not framework-agnostic in terms of JavaScript frameworks (React-only), it doesn't impose any specific styling methodology on your project.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install core packages
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks

# Optional packages
npm install @mantine/form  # Form management
npm install @mantine/dates  # Date/time components
npm install @mantine/notifications  # Notification system
```

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { MantineProvider, Button, Group, Text } from "@mantine/core";

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider
      theme={{
        colorScheme: "light",
        primaryColor: "blue",
        components: {
          Button: {
            styles: {
              root: {
                borderRadius: "4px",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      <Group>
        <Button>Primary button</Button>
        <Button variant="outline">Outline button</Button>

```
